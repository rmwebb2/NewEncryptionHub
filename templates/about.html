    <h1>About CipherGuard</h1>
    <p>
      CipherGuard is a web application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt data securely
      using industry-standard algorithms such as AES-256, RSA-2048, and ChaCha20. It’s designed
      for educational purposes as well as general usage, ensuring your sensitive information remains private.

    <h2>How AES Works</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</strong> is a symmetric block cipher.
      This means the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
      Key points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Symmetric Key:</strong> Both sender and receiver share the same secret key.</li>
      <li><strong>Block Cipher:</strong> AES operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits).</li>
      <li><strong>Key Sizes:</strong> Common key sizes include 128, 192, and 256 bits (we use AES-256 in this app).</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> AES is considered very secure and is widely used by governments and organizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How RSA Works</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)</strong> is an asymmetric encryption algorithm.
      This means it uses a pair of keys: a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.
      Key points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public/Private Key Pair:</strong> The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Length:</strong> Common RSA key sizes include 1024, 2048, or 4096 bits. We use 2048 bits here.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Often used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> The strength of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How ChaCha20 Works</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>ChaCha20</strong> is a modern stream cipher designed as an improvement over the Salsa20 family.
      It encrypts data byte-by-byte using a pseudo-random keystream generated from a 256-bit key and an 8-byte nonce.
      Key points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stream Cipher:</strong> Unlike block ciphers, ChaCha20 encrypts data continuously, which can be more efficient for certain types of data.</li>
      <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Optimized for high-speed encryption on modern processors, making it well-suited for mobile and web applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> ChaCha20 is considered secure and is used in protocols like TLS as a robust alternative to AES.</li>
      <li><strong>Nonce Usage:</strong> Requires a unique nonce for each encryption operation to ensure the keystream is never reused.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why We Use Multiple Algorithms</h2>
    <p>
      Each encryption algorithm offers its own strengths: AES is highly efficient for large volumes of data, RSA enables secure key exchange and digital signatures, and ChaCha20 offers a fast, secure stream cipher option that works well on various devices. By supporting multiple algorithms, CipherGuard provides flexibility and robust security for a range of encryption needs.
