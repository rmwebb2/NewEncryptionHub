    <h1>About CipherGuard</h1>
    <p>
      CipherGuard is a web application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt data securely
      using both symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) encryption algorithms.

    <h2>How AES Works</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</strong> is a symmetric block cipher.
      This means the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data. 
      Key points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Symmetric Key:</strong> Both sender and receiver share the same secret key.</li>
      <li><strong>Block Cipher:</strong> AES operates on fixed-size blocks of data (128 bits).</li>
      <li><strong>Key Sizes:</strong> Common key sizes include 128, 192, and 256 bits (we use AES-256 in this app).</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> AES is considered very secure and is widely used by governments and organizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How RSA Works</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)</strong> is an asymmetric encryption algorithm.
      This means it uses a pair of keys: a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.
      Key points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public/Private Key Pair:</strong> The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.</li>
      <li><strong>Key Length:</strong> Common RSA key sizes include 1024, 2048, or 4096 bits. We use 2048 bits here.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Often used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encrypting small amounts of data.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> The strength of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why We Use Both AES and RSA</h2>
    <p>
      AES is very efficient for bulk data encryption, while RSA is useful for securely exchanging keys 
      or signing data. Together, they provide strong security for various scenarios.
